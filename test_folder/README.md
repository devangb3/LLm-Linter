# Sample Application for Code Analysis

This folder contains sample files designed to demonstrate various architectural patterns and potential improvements that the Coding Assistant can identify.

## Files Overview

### Python Files
- **`database.py`** - Database connection logic with connection management
- **`user_model.py`** - User data model with embedded database operations
- **`auth_service.py`** - Authentication service with JWT token handling
- **`api.py`** - Flask API endpoints mixing HTTP and business logic
- **`config.py`** - Application configuration with some hardcoded values
- **`main.py`** - Main application entry point tying everything together

### JavaScript Files
- **`utils.js`** - Utility functions demonstrating repeated patterns

## Architectural Issues Demonstrated

### 1. **Repeated Database Connection Logic**
- Database connections are created in multiple files
- Connection setup code is duplicated across `database.py`, `user_model.py`, `auth_service.py`, and `api.py`
- **Potential Improvement**: Centralized connection manager

### 2. **Mixed Concerns**
- API endpoints in `api.py` contain business logic, validation, and database operations
- Models in `user_model.py` handle both data representation and persistence
- **Potential Improvement**: Separate layers for API, business logic, and data access

### 3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
- Different error handling patterns across files
- Some places use try/catch, others don't handle errors properly
- **Potential Improvement**: Standardized error handling middleware

### 4. **Hardcoded Configuration**
- Secrets and configuration values are hardcoded in `config.py`
- Database paths and API keys should be environment variables
- **Potential Improvement**: Environment-based configuration

### 5. **Tight Coupling**
- `main.py` directly imports and runs the Flask app
- Components are tightly coupled with direct dependencies
- **Potential Improvement**: Dependency injection and interface abstraction

### 6. **Repeated Utility Functions**
- Date formatting, validation, and API call patterns repeated in `utils.js`
- Authentication logic duplicated between Python and JavaScript
- **Potential Improvement**: Shared utility libraries

### 7. **Missing Abstractions**
- Direct SQL queries scattered throughout the codebase
- No repository pattern or data access layer
- **Potential Improvement**: Repository pattern for data access

## Expected AI Analysis Suggestions

When you run the Coding Assistant on this folder, it should identify:

1. **Database Connection Abstraction**: Suggest creating a centralized database manager
2. **Layer Separation**: Recommend separating API, business logic, and data access layers
3. **Configuration Management**: Suggest moving hardcoded values to environment variables
4. **Error Handling Standardization**: Recommend consistent error handling patterns
5. **Utility Consolidation**: Suggest consolidating repeated utility functions
6. **Security Improvements**: Point out hardcoded secrets and weak password hashing

## Running the Sample Application

```bash
# Install Flask if not already installed
pip install flask pyjwt

# Run the application
python main.py
```

The application will start a Flask server on `http://localhost:5000` with some basic API endpoints.

## Testing with Coding Assistant

To test the Coding Assistant with these files:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python main.py --path test_folder
```

This should provide detailed architectural suggestions for improving the codebase structure, separation of concerns, and code organization.
